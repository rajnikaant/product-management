# Product Management Playbook 
Since the time I have got into product management, I have only learnt by reading stuff daily. This is a collection of articles which made me learn/implement something new. 

## 1. Understanding The Customer 

## 2. Measuring Success 

####Setting the Right Goals
Stay away from measures like time on site, page views, number of connections, and so on. **These are your productâ€™s measures of success, not the users. You need to find what defines success for a user.** For example staying at a local's place is sucess for an Airbnb user, making a cab ride with minimum hassle (just get in and get out) is success for an Uber user, while being more productive at work is sucess for a Slack user. Once the sucess for users is defined, all you need to do is define the steps that the user takes to achieve this and optimize each one of them.
